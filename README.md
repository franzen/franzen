# 👋 Hi, I’m Nils Franzén

🚀 CISO/CIO with a deep technical background in software engineering and cloud security. I thrive at the intersection of security, product development, and infrastructure.

🛠️ Still an engineer at heart — I write code regularly and stay hands-on with modern development practices.

🔐 **Focus Areas**
- Product & Information Security
- Compliance (ISO 27001, SOC2, GDPR)
- Secure Software Development Lifecycle (SSDLC)
- Cloud-native architecture (GCP & Azure)
- Leadership in distributed engineering teams

💻 **Tech Background**
Former engineer turned executive, I’ve worked across:
- TypeScript, Go, Python, Java, C#
- Microservices and monolith-to-cloud migrations
- Web apps, APIs, and infrastructure-as-code
- DevOps, CI/CD pipelines, security tooling
